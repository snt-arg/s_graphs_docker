abstract_description: Mobile robots extract information from its environment to understand their current situation to enable intelligent decision making and autonomous task execution. In our previous work [1], we introduced the concept of Situation Graphs (S- Graphs) which combines in a single optimizable graph, the robot keyframes and the representation of the environment with geometric, semantic and topological abstractions. Although S- Graphs were built and optimized in real-time and demonstrated state-of-the-art results, they are limited to specific structured environments with specific hand-tuned dimensions of rooms and corridors. In this work, we present an advanced version of the Situational Graphs (S-Graphs+), consisting of the five layered optimizable graph that includes (1) metric layer along with the graph of free-space clusters (2) keyframe layer where the robot poses are registered (3) metric-semantic layer consisting of the extracted planar walls (4) novel rooms layer constraining the extracted planar walls (5) novel floors layer encompassing the rooms within a given floor level. S-Graphs+ demonstrates improved performance over S-Graphs efficiently extracting the room information while simultaneously improving the pose estimate of the robot, thus extending the robots situational awareness in the form of a five layered environmental model.
