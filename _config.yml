abstract_description: '3D scene graphs represent the environment in an
efficient graphical format of nodes and edges representing dif-
ferent geometric elements with suitable semantic attributes and
relational constraints with other elements. Nevertheless, existing
methods do not efficiently couple the scene graph with the
SLAM graph generating it, to simultaneously improve in real-
time the metric estimate of the robot pose or its map estimate. In
this direction, we present an evolved version of the Situational
Graphs (dubbed S-Graphs+), which jointly models in a single
optimizable graph a set of robot keyframes as well as the high-
level representations of the environment. S-Gaphs+ is a four-layered optimizable graph that includes:(1) a keyframes layer in which robot poses are estimated, (2)
a walls layer consisting of all the registered wall planes, (3) a
rooms layer constraining the mapped wall planes, and (4) a floors
layer encompassing the rooms within a given floor level. Fig. 1
shows an illustrative example. To efficiently represent rooms and
floors we present novel room and floor segmentation algorithms
utilizing the mapped wall planes and free-space clusters. We
test S-Graphs+ on simulated datasets representing distinct indoor
environments, on real datasets captured on several construction
sites and office environments, and on a public dataset captured
in indoor office environments. S-Graphs+ outperforms relevant
baselines in the majority of the datasets, while extending the
robot situational awareness by a four-layered scene model.'
